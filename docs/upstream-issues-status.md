# Upstream Issues Status

Companion status matrix for [upstream-issues.md](upstream-issues.md).

`upstream-issues.md` is an exported historical record from
`epoplavskis/homeassistant_salus`. Keep that export intact. Use this file for
local maintainer tracking.

Last reviewed: 2026-05-02.

## Status Labels

- `Solved locally`: fixed in this integration or in the pinned
  `salus-it600-client` version.
- `Closed upstream`: the exported upstream issue is already closed.
- `Backlog`: still open upstream and not confirmed fixed here.
- `Needs verification`: code may cover the case, but the exact issue report has
  not been retested.
- `Workaround documented`: the thread identifies a configuration/user action,
  not necessarily a code fix.
- `Not actionable`: question, sale, ownership, or historical note.
